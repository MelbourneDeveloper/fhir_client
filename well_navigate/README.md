# WellNavigate

This is a toolkit for working with health systems and health data. In particular, it talks to FHIR® servers and gives you a way to query and edit FHIR® resources. It runs on desktop, web and phones and can talk to any FHIR® server. The app is at its early stages and only implements resources like Patient and Appointment, but as the framework brings in all the other resources through auto-generated code, the app will be able to work with all FHIR® resources.

## Why WellNavigate?

[FHIR®](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html) is a global interopable health standard that is being adopted by health systems around the world. However, most FHIR® apps focus on specific use cases like bookings, medical records, staff records, and so on. WellNavigate is a generic tool for browsing and querying health data with tools for validating, modifying and cleaning it up. 

## Who is WellNavigate For?

WellNavigate is for anyone working with health data, in particular people working with the FHIR® standard. This includes developers, data scientists, health informaticians, and health professionals. Anyone who deals with health data or medical systems will find this app useful. 

## Integration

This app is part of a suite of tools designed to extend the interopability of the FHIR® standard. Reach out to [Christian](https://www.christianfindlay.com/#contact) for FHIR® consulting, integration and development services.

## Privacy

Privacy is critical for any health system. This app has transparent source so you can verify what the app does. The app does not store any data in the cloud. The app does not track you or send any data to third parties. The app only connects to the FHIR® server you specify.

The app may store health data on your device through file saving, but in these cases, you will be prompted with a "save as" dialog to choose where to save the file.

While this app may add cloud based functionality in future, the app will make it clear what data it stores where and why.
